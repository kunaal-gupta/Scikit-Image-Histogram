# Image Processing with Histogram Techniques

## Overview
This project implements various image processing techniques, focusing on grayscale and color image histogram operations. The code uses Python and popular libraries like OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Scikit-image to compute histograms, perform histogram equalization, and apply histogram matching for both grayscale and colored images.

## Features
- **Histogram Computation:** Calculate a 64-bin grayscale histogram of an image.
- **Histogram Equalization:** Equalize a 64-bin grayscale histogram to enhance contrast.
- **Histogram Comparison:** Compare histograms of two images using the Bhattacharyya Coefficient.
- **Histogram Matching:** Match histograms between two grayscale or colored images.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `scikit-image`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python scikit-image numpy matplotlib
